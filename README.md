Work Experience:

Waiter at Tunéz, Lampedusa: Working as a waiter in the dining room allowed me to understand what true teamwork is, especially under stress conditions and given the highly touristy location of Lampedusa, I had ample opportunity to practice foreign languages, especially English.
Work at Amnesty International: At Amnesty International, I worked as a street dialoguer, convincing people to join the organization to support its peace initiatives worldwide. This role challenged me to interact with people from different countries and allowed me to practice and refine foreign languages such as English and French.
